Downloading the Exercise
Once installed, you can use the CLI to download the exercise to your local machine using 
the following command (replacing <exercise-slug> and <track-slug> with the relevant values:

exercism download --exercise=<exercise-slug> --track=<track-slug>

You don't have to remember this command structure, as the exercise page lists the 
appropriate command for that exercise.

Once the download command has finished, the exercise's files will be downloaded to your local machine.

Solving the Exercise
The goal of each exercise is to create an implementation that passes all the tests. 
Such an implementation is known as a solution.

To help you with that, each exercise contains the following files:

README.md: the instructions that explain what is expected of you
HELP.md: information on how to run the tests and how to get help when you're stuck
HINTS.md (optional): hints to help solve the exercise
Test file(s): they contain the tests that verify your solution's correctness
Stub file(s): they provide a starting point to help you get started with building your implementation
Depending on the track, there might be other files that the track tooling requires for the tests to run.

Submitting your Solution
Once your solution passes all the tests, you can submit your solution using the following command:

exercism submit <implementation_file_paths>
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

Once again, you don't have to remember this command, as the exercise's HELP.md file will list the correct command.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:
